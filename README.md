- #### This is a screen recording application. You can record any screen or any window from your desktop.
- #### Just download setup file compatible with your OS and try it for yourself. 
- #### Click [here](https://github.com/prateek332/ScreenRecorder/releases/tag/DownloadSetupFiles) to download.
- #### If you cant' find setup file compatible with your OS then you can build your application by cloning the repository or download the source code and simply building the app yourself. You'll also need to create a tailwindcss file in `src/styles/index.css`. Click [here](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation#using-tailwind-cli) for more info.
